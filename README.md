# NUVI INTERVIEW CODE PROJECT

This is code to fulfil the requirements of the NUVI interview code project. Given the specific and simple goals of the test, I didn't implement features such as configuration, modularility, generalization, integration testing, and so forth that I would implement in a maintainable production-ready application.  However, If any additional features are wanted, please let me know, and I will add them. However, I did adhear to good naming and method abstraction concepts.

## Usage

   bundle install

   ./nuvi.rb

## Run unit tests
  
  ./unit_spec.rb 

## Run integration test
  
  ./spec/integration/nuvi_spec.rb
